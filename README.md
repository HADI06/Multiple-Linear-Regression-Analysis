# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Analysis
Welcome to the Multiple Linear Regression Analysis repository! This collection of Python scripts guides you through the steps of implementing Multiple Linear Regression using the scikit-learn library. The analysis focuses on predicting profits based on startup data from different states.
What's Inside:
Importing Dataset and EDA:

Importing essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Loading the startup dataset and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Visualizing correlations, state-wise profitability, and average profits.
Data Preprocessing:

Encoding categorical data to prepare it for modeling.
Separating the dataset into features (X) and labels (Y).
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Fitting Multiple Linear Regression:

Creating and fitting a Multiple Linear Regression model on the training set.
Understanding the intercept and coefficients of the model.
Predictions and Evaluation:

Predicting profits on the test set and evaluating the model using R-squared, MAE, and RMSE.
Making predictions on new data points outside the dataset.
Evaluation and Visualization:

Assessing model performance through metrics like R-squared and visualizing predictions against actual values.
Visualizing prediction errors using a histogram.
Customization and Experimentation:

Feel free to modify the scripts, experiment with different datasets, and adapt the code for your specific use cases.
Use this repository as a foundation for learning and implementing Multiple Linear Regression models.
Happy Modeling! ðŸ“Š
